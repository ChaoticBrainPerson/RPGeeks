Translating old druidic to Normal text

simply enter the Serial Number (Infinity's is 8691 - 9726 - PMGB - 1530 - ML, but any following the same order should work) and the text. encode_message will give you a string of zeros and ones that you can send to your friends, family or Twitch-Chat.

with the serial number and the ones and zeros message, you can use decode_message to translate this back into normal words. 

requires numpy 


If you don't know what the RPGeeks are, they are a bunch of science communicators that (ir)regularily stream a science DnD version over on twitch.tv/drsimonclark. Check them out on https://www.rpgeeks.co.uk/
